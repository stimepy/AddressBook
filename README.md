I use this peronally and well... it's broken.  I am fixing it for my personal use, however if anyone wants to jump in, 
or help out, please feel free.


Current Plan: 
Update to use SQLi  - Complete
Remove any deprecated PHP code.    - complete
Update to html 5        - Inproogress

Release  - Sure.  Why not?
