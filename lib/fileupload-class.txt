# ABOUT
#--------------------------------#

fileupload-class.php can be used to upload image and text files with a web 
browser. The uploaded file's name will get cleaned up - special characters
will be deleted, and spaces get replaced with underscores, and moved to 
a specified directory (on your server). fileupload-class.php also does its
best to determine the file's type (text, GIF, JPEG, etc). If the user
has named the file with the correct extension (.txt, .gif, etc), then
the class will use that, but if the user tries to upload an ex tensionless
file, PHP does can identify text, gif, jpeg, and png files for you. As
a last resort, if there is no specified extension, and PHP can not 
determine the type, you can set a default extension to be added.

#--------------------------------#
# REQUIREMENTS
#--------------------------------#

To run and have fun with fileupload-class.php you will need access to a 
Unix/Linux/*nix web server running Apache with the PHP module, a web 
browser that supports uploading (like Netscape), and the 2 other files 
that came with this. 

#--------------------------------#
# QUICK SETUP
#--------------------------------#

(1) Make a new directory within your with you web directory 
called "fileupload"

(2) Upload the files "fileupload-class.php" and "upload.php" to your 
fileupload direcotory

(3) Make another directory within the "fileupload" directory called "uploads"
and give it enough upload permissions for you web server to upload to it.
(usually, this means making it world writable)
 - cd /your/web/dir/fileupload
 - mkdir uploads
 - chmod 777 uploads
4) Open your web browser and test it it out:
   http://www.yourdomain.com/fileupload/upload.php
